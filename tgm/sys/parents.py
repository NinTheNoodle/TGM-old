    Conceptually an object is an entity if it exists in the world in

    the player character but also things like trigger zones and the points

    Conceptually an object is a component if it exists purely as an
    enhancement to another object. The idea being that if it makes more sense
    to abstractly attach this object to another object rather than place in
    a scene it is a component. Components should also do something, otherwise
    if the object is just data then the object should be a tag. An example is

    This object is intended to represent a level or some isolated universe.
    A useful example is using a separate world to hold the HUD in a game,

    exists in a separate universe to the level underneath. This concept can
    be extended, but the main idea being that objects in a world for the most

    more easily, and not polluting the namespace of the class they are
